# Breakpoints Per Branch

A Visual Studio Extension that associates your Visual Studio debugging breakpoints with Git branches.

As you switch between Git branches, the breakpoints associated with that git branch are restored.

This should be considered proof-of-concept code -- no real testing has been done.
